# 🔌 Serial Data Logger

This project is an open-source serial data logger that reads data from a serial USB port and logs it to a CSV file with timestamps (including milliseconds). Users can save or discard the data using keyboard shortcuts. The project is designed to assist with serial communication work, including Arduino projects and similar embedded system setups.

## ✨ Features
- 📡 Logs serial data in real-time from any USB serial device.
- 📝 Saves the data to a CSV file with a timestamp (including milliseconds).
- 🔄 Automatically detects previously used COM ports and prompts for confirmation.
- ⌨️ Uses keyboard shortcuts for control:
  - `Alt+C` to save the data and exit.
  - `Ctrl+X` to discard the data and exit without saving.

## 🛠️ Applications
- **Arduino Projects**: Easily log sensor data or debug information from Arduino boards via serial communication.
- **Embedded Systems**: Works with any microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP32) that communicates over a serial interface.
- **General Serial Work**: Use for data logging, debugging, or monitoring serial communications in various scenarios.

## 📦 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- 🖥️ [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16 or higher
- 💾 Git installed on your machine ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/))
- 🔌 Serial USB device or any microcontroller with serial communication (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

### Installing the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and clone the repository using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuhain/serial-data-logger.git
   cd serial-data-logger
   ```

2. **Install the Required Go Dependencies**:
   You need to install the `tarm/serial` package for serial communication and the `golang.org/x/term` package for raw terminal input. Run the following commands:
   
   ```bash
   go get github.com/tarm/serial
   go get golang.org/x/term
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Now, run the Go program:
   
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   If this is the first time running, it will ask you for the COM port (e.g., `COM3` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`). The port will be saved for future use and prompted for confirmation on subsequent runs.

### 💡 Usage

1. **Reading Serial Data**:
   - Once the program starts, it will begin reading data from the serial port and logging it to the terminal.
   - It will also log the data to a CSV file with a timestamp (in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm` where `mmm` is milliseconds).
   
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Press **Alt+C** to save the CSV file and exit the program.
   - Press **Ctrl+X** to exit the program without saving the CSV file (the file will be deleted).

### 📊 Example CSV Output
Below is an example of what the output in the CSV file looks like:

```csv
Timestamp,Data
2024-09-08 13:45:23.123,Data received from the serial device
2024-09-08 13:45:23.234,Another data entry
```

### 🛠️ Software Requirements
- **Go (Golang)** 1.16 or higher
- **Serial Device** (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi with UART)
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
